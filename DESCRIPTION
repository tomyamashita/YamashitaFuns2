Description: This package provides functions created for dealing with camera traps, LiDAR, and other data used for my dissertation research. 
    Functions were created specifically for working with my own data and they may not work well with other data organization methods. 
    Additional functions are added that I have written for other purposes and other people as they appear. 
    Everything is a work in progress and it is unlikely that this package will ever reach v1.0.
